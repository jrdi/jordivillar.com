It's hard to believe that a year has already passed since I joined the Tinybird team. Time really does fly when you're having fun!

It's been a wild ride, full of learning, growth, and some truly unforgettable experiences. As I reflect on my first year at the company, I wanted to take some time to share my thoughts.

#### Culture

One of the things that attracted me to Tinybird in the first place was the culture. From the very beginning, I felt welcomed and supported by my colleagues. Everyone is encouraged to speak up and share their ideas, no matter their level of experience or seniority.

I'm not going to lie, the bar is set high and everyone excels at their job, which was initially intimidating, but I have been able to adapt and gain confidence thanks to the supportive nature of my colleagues.

Another aspect of the culture that I've appreciated is the focus on continuous learning and growth. At Tinybird, we are encouraged to take on new challenges, whether that means learning a new technology or taking on a leadership role. Also, on the technical side we are pushed to dig into the details, and to invest considerable time to understand how things work. Even if there is no clear immediate return, the idea is to progressively increase the collective knowledge as much as possible.

Transparency is also valued at the company, and everyone has access to key metrics and data that helps us understand the performance of the business and clients.

#### Client-Facing Role

As a member of the Customer Success team, my role is primarily focused on working with our clients to understand their needs and help them get the most out of our platform. This has been a really rewarding experience for me, as I've had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of clients.

Being honest, one of the things that I was worried about the role was exactly this. I've never been on a similar position, and talking to clients can be intimidating.

Putting in perspective, is not that different from offering support to internal teams when you're working at the Data Team. Also, at Tinybird the Customer Success team is formed by technical people and developers, we contribute to the product, and are closely involved in the development process.

Our clients are also developers, and the technical side at their companies so we speak the same language, they know their stack and their data, so when they come to us is because they have a real challenge, that don't know how to solve (or didn't manage to solve with other tools). Being able to help them and work together, to push Tinybird to its limits, trying to cut latency by few milliseconds each time, or to implement a difficult use case it's a super interesting, and enriching journey.

#### ClickHouse

One of the things that I've learned a lot about during my first year at Tinybird is ClickHouse, the open source column-oriented database management system that powers our platform. I've come to appreciate the many benefits of ClickHouse, including its ability to handle massive amounts of data with lightning-fast performance and its flexibility when it comes to data modeling and querying.

I've been able to test many features, trying to think out of the box, attacking challenges following different approaches, and write internal reports on my findings. I have also managed to submit some pull requests, and do few contributions upstream. All of them were quite simple, and didn't require understanding the codebase but still felt good to contribute to a big open source project.

#### Looking Ahead

As I look ahead to my second year at Tinybird, I'm excited to continue learning and growing with the company. I'm looking forward to tackling new challenges and working with our clients to find innovative solutions to their business needs.

I'm also excited to see what the future holds for Tinybird as a company. With our focus on continuous innovation and our commitment to helping developers building faster API on top of terabytes of data.

Overall, my first year at Tinybird has been an incredible journey, and I'm grateful to be part of such a talented and supportive team. Here's to many more years of growth and success!
