It's hard to believe that a year has already passed since I joined the Tinybird team. Time really does fly when you're having fun!

It's been a wild ride, full of learning, growth, and some truly unforgettable experiences. As I reflect on my first year at the company, I wanted to take some time to share my thoughts.

#### Culture

One of the things that attracted me to Tinybird in the first place was the culture. From the very beginning, I felt welcomed and supported by my colleagues. Everyone is encouraged to speak up and share their ideas, no matter their level of experience or seniority.

I'm not going to lie, although the bar is set high and everyone excels at their job, which was initially intimidating, I have been able to adapt and gain confidence thanks to the supportive nature of my colleagues.

Another aspect of the culture that I've appreciated is the focus on continuous learning and growth. At Tinybird, we are encouraged to take on new challenges, whether that means learning a new technology or taking on a leadership role. The company also values transparency, and everyone has access to key metrics and data that helps us understand how the business is performing.

#### Client-Facing Role

As a member of the Customer Success team, my role is primarily focused on working with our clients to understand their needs and help them get the most out of our platform. This has been a really rewarding experience for me, as I've had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of clients from different industries and geographies.

One of the things that I've enjoyed most about this role is the opportunity to work closely with clients to understand their business needs and help them find creative solutions using our platform. It's been gratifying to see the impact that our work has had on our clients' businesses, and I've learned a lot from the different challenges and opportunities that each project has presented.

#### ClickHouse

One of the things that I've learned a lot about during my first year at Tinybird is ClickHouse, the open source column-oriented database management system that powers our platform. I've come to appreciate the many benefits of ClickHouse, including its ability to handle massive amounts of data with lightning-fast performance and its flexibility when it comes to data modeling and querying.

One of the things that I've found particularly interesting about ClickHouse is its ability to handle real-time data processing and analytics. With ClickHouse, it's possible to analyze large amounts of data in near real-time, which makes it a powerful tool for businesses that need to make data-driven decisions quickly.

#### Looking Ahead

As I look ahead to my second year at Tinybird, I'm excited to continue learning and growing with the company. I'm looking forward to tackling new challenges and working with our clients to find innovative solutions to their business needs.

I'm also excited to see what the future holds for Tinybird as a company. With our focus on continuous innovation and our commitment to helping businesses make data-driven decisions, I have no doubt that we will continue to make a big impact in the world of data analytics.

Overall, my first year at Tinybird has been an incredible journey, and I'm grateful to be part of such a talented and supportive team. Here's to many more years of growth and success!
