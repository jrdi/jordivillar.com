Hola! I'm Jordi Villar, a data generalist from Barcelona.

What I do enjoy the most and what I've proven I am good at is bringing value to companies, working in an agile environment, and solving problems that will make the company move forward.

Currently, I'm a Data Engineer at [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co).

Prior to joining this role, I was leading the data efforts at [Kognia Sports](https://kogniasports.com) (a sports analytics company). Before I was building and leading the data science and machine learning team at a successful ad-tech company ([Smadex](https://smadex.com), acquired by Entravision in 2018).

I believe in collaboration, open source, and helping others.

I hold a Telecommunications Engineering degree (roughly equivalent to an ECE, master included) from the UPC in Barcelona.
